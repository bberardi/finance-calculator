**Gap**: Available free sites provide easy views of a single loan, like a mortage, with what-if scenarios to see how extra payments or a different interest rate affect the lifetimeof the loan. I have not been able to find resources that allow you to view and perform such calculations on multiple loans/investments at once. This resulted in me copying the data one by one into excel to see them, or simply ignoring those resources all together and using excel.

**Purpose**: To view and perform what-ifs on loans and (simpler) investments to view the overall financial position, without math done by the user.
